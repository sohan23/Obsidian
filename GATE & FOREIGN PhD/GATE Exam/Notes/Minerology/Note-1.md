+ # Introduction to Minerology
## States of Matter
* Three states can be seen as **solid, liquid, gaseous**.
* **Minerals** are a naturally occurring inorganic substances which have a _definite chemical compositions, and which commonly, but not always is crystalline_. ^7ba8aa

## Elements, compounds and mixtures
* A **pure substance** is one that possesses characteristic and invariable properties. 
* Pure substances may be two types: **elements** and **compounds**.
	* **Elements** are pure substances which not as yet been split up into simpler substances by any ordinary *chemical* means.
	* **Compounds** are pure substances made up of two or more elements. They are formed as a result of *chemical change*, and are different from mere **mixtures** in the following ways.
		* The constituting elements are combined in definite proportions by weight.
		* A compound cannot easily be split up, whereas the components of a mixture usually be separated by mechanical means.
		* The properties of a compound are often very different from those of the elements it contains.
		* *Heat is either given out or absorbed when a compound is formed*.
* **Minerals** are compounds of their constituent elements, whereas **rocks** are mixtures of their component minerals. For example, rock granite  is a mixture of several minerals, one of which is quartz, $\bf{SiO_{2}}$. ![[Note-1#^7ba8aa]]
## Atomic Bonding
There are four main types of bonding in atomic [[lattices]], as follows:
1. **Ionic** or *heteropolar* bonding between ions of opposite electrical charge.
2. **Covalent** or *homopolar* bonding, in which atoms share electrons.
3. **Metallic** bonding, 
4. **Van er Waals** or *residual* bonding due to weak forces present in all crystals.
