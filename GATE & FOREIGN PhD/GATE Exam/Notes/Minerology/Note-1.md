+ # Introduction to Minerology
## States of Matter
* Three states can be seen as **solid, liquid, gaseous**.
* **Minerals** are a naturally occurring inorganic substances which have a _definite chemical compositions, and which commonly, but not always is crystalline_. ^7ba8aa

## Elements, compounds and mixtures
* A **pure substance** is one that possesses characteristic and invariable properties. 
* Pure substances may be two types: **elements** and **compounds**.
	* **Elements** are pure substances which not as yet been split up into simpler substances by any ordinary *chemical* means.
	* **Compounds** are pure substances made up of two or more elements. They are formed as a result of *chemical change*, and are different from mere **mixtures** in the following ways.
		* The constituting elements are combined in definite proportions by weight.
		* A compound cannot easily be split up, whereas the components of a mixture usually be separated by mechanical means.
		* The properties of a compound are often very different from those of the elements it contains.
		* *Heat is either given out or absorbed when a compound is formed*.
* **Minerals** are compounds of their constituent elements, whereas **rocks** are mixtures of their component minerals. For example, rock granite  is a mixture of several minerals, one of which is quartz, $\text{SiO}_{2}$. ![[Note-1#^7ba8aa]]
## Atomic Bonding
There are four main types of bonding in atomic [[lattices]], as follows:
1. **Ionic** or *heteropolar* bonding between ions of opposite electrical charge.
2. **Covalent** or *homopolar* bonding, in which atoms share electrons.
3. **Metallic** bonding, [[Note]] 
4. **Van er Waals** or *residual* bonding due to weak forces present in all crystals.

## Ion Size and Ionic Radii
**Goldschmidt's Rule** - 
![[C. D. Gribble (auth.) - Rutley’s Elements of Mineralogy-Springer Netherlands (1989).pdf#page=26&selection=114,0,149,17]] 
 1. Ions of similar radii (± 15%) and the same charge will enter into a crystal in amounts proportional to their concentration in the liquid.
 2. When two ions with the same charge compete for a lattice site, the ion of smaller radius will be preferentially incorporated into the growing crystal.
 3. When two ions of the same radius (± 15%) compete for a lattice site, the ion with the higher charge will be preferentially incorporated into a growing crystal. 
#### Radius Ratio- 
The Coordination number of an ion can be predicted by determining a ratio, which represents the radius of the cation divided by that of the oxygen anion;  that is ${r_{x}}/{r_{O^{2-}}}$, where x is any cation ($\text{K}^{+},\text{Fe}^{2+},\text{Al}^{3+},\text{etc.}$)
