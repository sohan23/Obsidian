# Functions

> A pieces of code to perform some certain operations
###### table showing basic operations-

|   Operations   | Sign |
|:--------------:|:----:|
|    Addition    |  +   |
|    Division    |  /   |
| Exponentiation |  **  |
| Multiplication |  *   |
|  Substraction  |  -   |

 These are some inbuilt operations for the Python programming language to use.
#### *Now if the need is to use **complex mathematical expressions*** then we have use something called **Modules**. 
- A _module_ is a group of code items such as functions that are related to one another. Individual modules are often in a group referred to as a _library_.
- Modules can be loaded using `import`. Functions that are part of the module **`modulename`** can then be used by typing **`modulename.functionname()`**. For example, **`sin()`** is a function that is part of the `math` module, and used by typing **`math.sin()`** with some number between the parentheses.
- Within a given Jupyter Notebook the variables you define earlier in the notebook will be available for use in the cells that follow as long as you have already executed the cells.
- Modules may also contain constants such as `math.pi`.

# Variables

> as simply can be put, like in algebra variables are such expressions which doesn't have any pre-defined values, rather the other definitive values can be stored and used for the calculations.

In the python program simply assigning value to variables is straightforward. To assign a value, simply **`variable_name = value`**.
