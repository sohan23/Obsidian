Q.77 A student interpreted a four layer Schlumberger resistivity sounding data and obtained the resistivities () and thicknesses (h) as follows: 1=100 m, 2=20 m, 3=1500 m and 4=50 m; h1=50 m, h2=10 m and h3=20 m.

GATE 2018 GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS GG 20/20 Q.81 Consider a laterally homogeneous and isotropic earth model with a flat horizontal surface and three horizontal layers underlain by a half-space. A seismic reflection survey was simulated on this model with the sources and receivers placed on the surface. The table below lists the root mean square (rms) velocities, Vrms, and zero-offset two-way traveltimes t0 for the three reflection events from the bottom of each of the three layers observed in a pre-stack CDP (CMP) gather. The interval velocity of the second layer is _______ m/s.

The flux of the vector field through a sphere of unit radius is _________. (Use 𝜋 = 3.14) Q.83 A horizontally travelling surface wave with a wavelength of 20 m is attenuated by a linear and uniform receiver array consisting of 4 receivers if the minimum receiver spacing is ________ m. Q.84 An end-on marine survey is carried out with equal and uniform shot and receiver spacing.
