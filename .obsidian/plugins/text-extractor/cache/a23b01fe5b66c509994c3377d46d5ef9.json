The computer allotted to you at the examination center runs a specialized software that permits only one answer to be selected for multiple choice questions using a mouse. Your answers shall be updated and saved on a server periodically and at the end of the examination. 2. To login, enter your Registration Number and password provided in the envelope. Go through the symbols used in the test and understand the meaning before you start the examination. You can view all questions by clicking on the View All Questions button in the screen after the start of the examination. 3. To answer a question, select the question using the selection panel on the screen and choose the correct answer by clicking on the radio button next to the answer. To change the answer, just click on another option. If you wish to leave a previously answered question unanswered, click on the button next to the selected option. 4. The examination will automatically stop at the end of 3 hours. 5. There are a total of 65 questions carrying 100 marks. Except questions Q.26 – Q.30, all the other questions are of multiple choice type with only one correct answer. Questions Q.26 - Q.30 require a numerical answer, and a number should be entered using the virtual keyboard on the monitor. 6. Questions Q.1 – Q.25 of Part-A are common to both Geology and Geophysics and carry 1 mark each. Part B contains two sections: Section 1 (Geology) only for Geology candidates and Section 2 (Geophysics) only for Geophysics candidates. Questions Q.26 – Q.55 in each of these sections carry 2 marks each. The 2 marks questions include two pairs of common data questions and two pairs of linked answer questions. The answer to the second question of the linked answer questions depends on the answer to the first question of the pair. If the first question in the linked pair is wrongly answered or is unattempted, then the answer to the second question in the pair will not be evaluated. 7. Questions Q.56 – Q.65 belong to General Aptitude (GA) section and carry a total of 15 marks. Questions Q.56 – Q.60 carry 1 mark each, and questions Q.61 – Q.65 carry 2 marks each. 8.
