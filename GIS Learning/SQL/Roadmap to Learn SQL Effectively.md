The process is divided into five forms of normalization, with each form building upon the last. the normalization process is integral to designing efficient and effective databases.

#### Normal Form Levels

There are several normal form in database normalization, and each level has specific criteria that must be met in order for a table to be considered in that normal form Normalization helps to reduce data redundancy and improve the overall structure and efficiency of a database. The first normal form requires that all entries in table must be atomic, meaning each entry cannot have multiple values. Second normal form requires that each non-key attribute in a table must dependent on the entirety of the primary key. Third normal form requires that each non-key attribute in a table must be dependent only on the primary key and not on other non-key attributes. Higher normal form levels, such as Boyce-Codd normal form and fourth normal form, have more criteria and are not always necessary all databases.

#### Normal Techniques

The first step in learning SQL effectively is to understand the basic or normal techniques.
