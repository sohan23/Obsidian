abstract = {The research aims to study the urban heat island in Bangkok using remote sensing and Geo-information sciences, to determine the relationship between the UHI phenomenon and energy consumption and establish an electricity conservation plan. In this study, we investigated electricity consumption, solar radiation intensity, climate data, land surface temperature data, and land cover change. The quantified LST obtained from satellite imagery is used to identify areas exposed to the UHI effect. The quantified data is validated through field and observed measurements. We also illustrate LST spatial distribution and subsequent land use land cover types related to high LST. The relationship between LST, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the Normalized Difference Built Index was analyzed. LST was measured and correlated with climate data from meteorological stations. The relationship between increased LST and energy consumption was illustrated through linear regression analysis. In the results, the energy consumption and UHI illustrate a positive relationship. Electricity consumption and LST have a high correlation of 70-90%. In the hope to mitigate the UHI effect, appropriate mitigation measures are needed to minimize its impact. Mitigation measures such as the reduction of electricity consumption by encouraging citizens to be more conscious of air conditioning use and private transportation use. Another mitigation measure is incorporating sustainable urban planning principles techniques into urban expansion such as increasing urban green spaces and the use of public transportation.},

abstract = {Road transport is one of the main contributors to increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, consequently aggravating global warming, but it is also one of the sectors that most suffer from climate change, which causes extreme weather events. Thus, strategies, also called adaptation measures, have been discussed to minimize the impacts of climate change on transport systems and their infrastructure; however, a knowledge gap is evident in the literature. Therefore, this article develops a systematic review with a bibliometric approach, still scarce in the literature, in renowned databases, focusing on studies developed on adaptation measures for road infrastructure. The results show that, since the development of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an increasing amount of studies on the theme have been published in recognized journals such as Science of the Total Environment, Energy and Buildings and Urban Climate, analyzing climate threats such as intense precipitations and high temperatures that have led to biophysical impacts such as flooding and urban heat island. In addition, for each type of adverse weather condition, many impacts on road infrastructure can be listed, as well as ways to detect these impacts, and adaptation measures that can be used to minimize these problems.},

abstract = {The term heat island describes built up areas that are hotter than nearby rural areas. The annual mean air temperature of a city with 1 million people or more can be 1.8-5.4°F (1-3°C) warmer than its surroundings. In the evening, the difference can be as high as 22°F (12°C). Heat islands can affect communities by increasing summertime peak energy demand, air conditioning costs, air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, heat-related illness and mortality, and water quality (EPA, 2013). Urban heat islands are one of the most important problems of cities today and are experienced in Turkey similar to other cities in the world due to the spatial increase in urbanisation. It is known that the existence of green spaces has an important role in decreasing the negative effects of urban heat islands. The objective of this study is to determine the cooling effect of the Ataturk Forest Natural Park, which is 26.6 ha located in the city centre. Within this scope, mobile temperature values were taken at 41 points, 250 m apart, within the Ataturk Forest Natural Park and its surroundings. The result of the geostatistical analysis shows a temperature difference of up to 5.5°C between the Ataturk Forest National Park and its surroundings. This difference can be effective over an approximately 400 m radius.},

Increasing demand for building refurbishment projects will lead to an increase in organizational interactions in the construction works as building refurbishment works involve interactions among many different organizations and it can cause Inter-Organizational conflict (IOC) among organizations involved in projects. This paper adopted an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) approach to analyses IOC in building refurbishment projects. For this study, a fivepoint Likert Scale was adopted to ensure the instruments of the study are reliable. The researcher ultimately sent questionnaires as a web-link and email invitation to 1050 construction firms and 733 architectural firms. The questionnaire sent to managers and professionals from construction and architectural firms in Malaysia. Finally, one-hundred-seventy-nine (179) refurbishment projects formed a database for this paper. The finding of this paper shows the IOC factors that contribute to the improve the performance of building refurbishment project can be conflict during the construction stage, conflict between the client and the consultant, task expectations, basic responsibilities, final duration, project’s goals, conflict between the client and the contractor, final cost, final quality, standards of behaviors, conflict between the contractor and the consultant, interference and conflict during the design stage.},

abstract = {The urban heat island effect has posed negative impacts on urban areas with increased cooling energy demand followed by an altered thermal environment. While unusually high temperature in urban areas has been often attributed to complex urban settings, the function of urban forests has been considered as an effective heat mitigation strategy. To investigate the cooling effect of urban forests and their influence range, this study examined the spatiotemporal changes in land surface temperature (LST) of urban forests and surrounding areas by using Landsat imageries. LST, the size of the urban forest, its vegetation cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were investigated for 34 urban forests and their surrounding areas at a series of buffer areas in Seoul, South Korea. The mean LST of urban forests was lower than that of the overall city, and the threshold distance from urban forests for cooling effect was estimated to be roughly up to 300 m. The group of large-sized urban forests showed significantly lower mean LST than that of small-sized urban forests. The group of urban forests with higher NDVI showed lower mean LST than that of urban forests with lower mean NDVI in a consistent manner. A negative linear relationship was found between the LST and size of urban forest (r = −0.36 to −0.58), size of vegetation cover (r = −0.39 to −0.61), and NDVI (r = −0.42 to −0.93). Temporal changes in NDVI were examined separately on a specific site, Seoul Forest, that has experienced urban forest dynamics. LST of the site decreased as NDVI improved by a land-use change from a barren racetrack to a city park. It was considered that NDVI could be a reliable factor for estimating the cooling effect of urban forest compared to the size of the urban forest and/or vegetation cover.},

The increase of buildings in cities is reflecting the growth of human activities resulted in a significant temperature increase and warmer pattern in the urban area than the surrounding countryside. The phenomenon defined as urban heat island. This study investigates the application and efficiency of the green roof as an approach to mitigate urban heat island and reducing indoor temperature in a building. Two types of roof models, which consist of vegetative roof and non-vegetative roof, were built to investigate the efficiency of vegetated roof in reducing indoor temperature compared to the non-vegetated roof. The outdoor and indoor temperature and humidity of each roof model were monitored by using RH520 Thermo Hygrometer. The data was collected for three times in a week for 9 weeks at 9:00am to 5:00pm. It was found that the indoor average temperature data for vegetative roof could be reduced 2.4 ̊C from the outdoor average temperature and 0.8 ̊C for non-vegetative roof. The difference of temperature reduction for vegetative roof was greater than the nonvegetative roof, thus indicate that green roof was highly efficient in reducing indoor temperature and mitigate urban heat island impact.},

abstract = {Choosing the best LBCs is still debated among researchers due to the errors resulted. However, several recommendations have been documented to control the errors propagated by LBCs. One of the recommendations is employing higher resolutions LBCs. In the present, many LBCs are developed with various resolutions; spatially and temporally, for many applications but no claims regarding the best LBCs for tropical climate modelling have yet been documented. Therefore, this study intends to analyse the impacts of lateral boundary condition resolution during numerical downscaling within a tropical city. This study serves as a site-specific investigation to determine the suitable LBCs for the focused study area. Two widely used LBCs with different resolutions were utilized to initiate the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulation model. The performances of the two LBCs were compared using statistical tests and analyses. The study has found that the LBC with higher resolutions excels the other LBC during inter-monsoon season. Nevertheless, it was identified that both LBCs were able to provide reliable reconstruction of the tropical climate condition of the Kuala Lumpur City as portrayed by similar results obtained. Thus, it is concluded that both LBCs can be employed in numerical downscaling for tropical urban regions similar to the Kuala Lumpur City.},

abstract = {The contribution presents selected characteristics of turbulence calculated on the base of long term measurements in Łodź, central Poland (population ca 750,000). Turbulent characteristics were measured with the aid of fast respond sensors (sonic anemometers) at two points in the city centre. At the first point data were collected in years 2000-2003 and at the second point measurements are continued since 2005. At both stations sensors were mounted at thin masts at the level (37m and 42m above ground), significantly taller than mean building height (11m and 17m respectively). The study presents integral characteristics of turbulence at both stations. Typical integral characteristics (a drag coefficient and normalized standard deviations of wind component and temperature) are calculated as a function of stability parameter. Results show good agreement with functions predicted by Monin-Obukhov similarity theory.},

In the study, the APAC indicators were first statistically validated based on data from panels of experts using structural equation modeling. The validated indicators were subsequently transformed into a questionnaire to measure the individual-level APAC index. For ease of interpretation, the APAC index was converted into an APAC grade. The APAC grade was compared against the grading criteria based on Air Quality Index (AQI) levels to assess the individual-level health risks from air pollution. The proposed APAC-based self-assessment program to determine the individual-level health impacts from air pollution could be adopted as an economical and efficient alternative to costly and complicated clinical assessment.},

 Newtown is a planned city built over a short time period. It is suitable for climate and thermal research, particularly formulating urban planning strategies to analyse problems such as urban heat islands (UHIs). Herein, a comprehensive approach was demonstrated for determining changes in UHI distribution during 1989–2048 in two Newtowns with different urban planning. A significant increase in built-up areas was observed from 1989 (< 5%) to 2018 (> 40%) in both Newtowns. However, this increase significantly varied (approximately 12.25%) with urban planning in the areas where UHIs occurred before and after development. Moreover, without effective mitigation, the built-up area in each Newtown is estimated to increase to approximately 60%, and the surface UHI intensity in most areas to increase by 4 °C in 2048. Thus, these results combined with architectural assessment models can improve the understanding of thermal environmental impacts of urbanisation and help mitigate heat island hazards.},

Bursa, which is the fourth largest metropolitan city in Turkey, was selected as the study area, and Landsat multi-temporal images of the summer season were used. Firstly, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and index-based built-up index (IBI) were created using the bands of Landsat images, and LULC classes were determined by applying automatic thresholding. The LST values were calculated using thermal images and SUHI effects were determined. The results show that NDVI, SAVI, MNDWI and IBI indices can be used effectively for the determination of the urban, vegetation and water LULC classes for SUHI studies, with overall classification accuracies between 89.60% and 95.90% for the used images. According to the obtained results, generally the LST values increased for almost all land cover areas between the years 2002 and 2020. The SUHI magnitudes were computed by using two methods, and it was found that there was an important increase in the 18-year time period.},

abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon is a particular climate change impact in urban areas that can trigger adverse effects on environmental conditions. This effect is usually worsened by increasing anthropogenic activities. While the impact of UHI has mostly been studied in metropolitans around the world, few studies are presented investigating the outcome in mid-sized cities. This study aims to assess spatial distribution of Urban Heat Island (UHI) in Bogor city, Indonesia, by utilizing thermal data (Band-10) from Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS. The Landsat imagery was acquired in May 2021, in the beginning of the dry season. The result of study shows Land Surface Temperature (LST) values ranged from 26.23 to 33.76°C, with an average temperature of 31.29°C, while the range of NDVI was between 0.08 to 0.55. Further, the correlation between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was calculated to investigate the relationship between vegetation density and surface temperature condition for examining the outlook and possibilities to minimize the impact of UHI through improving vegetal conditions. A negative correlation suggests that expanding vegetation coverage can reduce urban heat island impacts by 35%, and other factors influence the rest. The land surface temperature threshold to determine UHI is 32.01°C, so the UHI area was identified at ca. 13.12 km2 around the city centre.},

abstract = {Abstract. The main objectives of this study are (i) to calculate Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat imageries, (ii) to determine the UHI effects from Landsat 7 ETM+ (June 5, 2001) and Landsat 8 OLI (June 17, 2014) imageries, (iii) to examine the relationship between LST and different Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) types for the years 2001 and 2014. The study is implemented in the central districts of Antalya. Initially, the brightness temperatures are retrieved and the LST values are calculated from Landsat thermal images. Then, the LU/LC maps are created from Landsat pan-sharpened images using Random Forest (RF) classifier. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image, ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) and DMSP_OLS nighttime lights data are used as auxiliary data during the classification procedure. Finally, UHI effect is determined and the LST values are compared with LU/LC classes. The overall accuracies of RF classification results were computed higher than 88 % for both Landsat images. During 13-year time interval, it was observed that the urban and industrial areas were increased significantly. Maximum LST values were detected for dry agriculture, urban, and bareland classes, while minimum LST values were detected for vegetation and irrigated agriculture classes. The UHI effect was computed as 5.6 °C for 2001 and 6.8 °C for 2014. The validity of the study results were assessed using MODIS/Terra LST and Emissivity data and it was found that there are high correlation between Landsat LST and MODIS LST data (r2 = 0.7 and r2 = 0.9 for 2001 and 2014, respectively).},

abstract = {The international scientific community has indicated that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are likely the main cause of rising temperatures since the mid-twentieth century. Cities have not only been a major contributor to these emissions but are also in locations that will experience the impacts most intensely. Accounting for more than half of the world's population, most built assets and economic activity is concentrated in cities - factors that make these environments highly vulnerable to climate change. The impacts caused by climate change are already being felt in urban centers and have been increasing in recent years. The main problems involving climate change for cities are rising temperatures, rising sea levels, heat islands, floods, and extreme events. Most Brazilian cities already have environmental problems associated with development patterns and transformation of geographical areas. Exacerbated changes in the hydrological cycle by reason of global warming tend to accentuate the existing risks such as floods, landslides, heat waves, and limitations on the supply of potable water. This article presents a case study of Rio de Janeiro city on how the city is acting to confront climate change through adaptation strategies.},

abstract = {The formulation of spatial planning strategies in an area is strongly influenced by the development of issues and problems in the area. Spatial planning policies contained in a regional regulation must be able to be aware of and deal with all current and future problems. Urban Heat Island) is currently a very growing issue in various regions in Indonesia which is influenced by many factors, one of which is the increase in built-up land. The issue of the Urban Heat Island is important because its effects are starting to be felt, including natural degradation, health, economic losses to excessive energy use. One of the most dominant areas in contributing to hot temperatures in urban areas is the industrial area. Kendal Regency is one of the regions in Indonesia with a fairly dominant industrial estate development. Industrial areas that are synonymous with built-up land, air pollution and the lack of green open spaces are one of the triggers for an increase in temperature. In contrast to the negative effects caused, the development of industrial estates in Kendal Regency is one of the drivers of the regional economy so that its existence is considered important. This study aims to understand spatial planning policies in response to the Urban Heat Island in the Kendal Regency industrial area. The research method used is spatial analysis using Landsat 8 imagery with supervised classification to see the UHI phenomenon in the Kendal industrial area, the results of which are used as a basis for evaluating spatial policies in response to UHI. The spatial policy of Kendal Regency in the designation of industrial areas has not fully responded to the UHI phenomenon in industrial areas, although 13 of the 14 clauses indicate the potential for an increase in surface temperature. UHI in the Kendal Regency spatial policy has not been seen as a threat to urban areas. Mitigation efforts against UHI mentioned are only in the form of providing green open space and waste management. It is hoped that this research can be input in improving spatial planning policies in the Kendal Regency industrial area, especially to suppress the increase in temperature.},
