# [[Electricity Consumption]] Datasets

#### Government agencies: 
Government bodies responsible for energy or statistical data often provide datasets on electricity consumption. Check the websites of energy departments or statistical agencies at the national, state, or local levels. Examples include the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/), [European Union Open Data Portal](https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/home), and national statistical offices.

#### International organizations: 
Organizations like the [International Energy Agency (IEA)](https://www.iea.org/), [World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/home), and [United Nations (UN)](https://data.un.org/) may offer datasets on electricity consumption at the global or regional level. They often provide comprehensive energy statistics and reports.

#### Research institutions and universities: 
Research institutions and universities often conduct studies on energy consumption and maintain datasets related to electricity usage. Explore the websites or data repositories of renowned research institutions or universities that focus on energy, climate, or sustainability.

#### Energy industry organizations: 
Associations and organizations in the energy industry may provide access to datasets related to electricity consumption. For example, industry associations for renewable energy, electric utilities, or energy efficiency may have relevant data.

#### Open data platforms: 
Open data platforms host a wide range of datasets, including those related to electricity consumption. Websites like [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/), [Data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/), or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) offer various datasets, including energy-related data. Additionally, some countries have dedicated open data portals where you can find electricity consumption datasets specific to that region.

#### Research publications: 
Research papers or reports on electricity consumption often include datasets as supplementary materials. Explore academic journals, conference proceedings, or reports from reputable energy and environmental research organizations for datasets used in their studies.

When accessing these datasets, be sure to review the terms of use and any licensing requirements. Some datasets may require permission or may have specific conditions for their use. Additionally, pay attention to the data format, variables included, and the time period covered in the datasets to ensure they align with your specific needs.

It's worth mentioning that the availability and extent of datasets may vary depending on the region, granularity, and specific parameters of interest.

# [[Urban Heat Island]] Datasets

#### National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI): 
The NCEI provides access to a variety of climate and weather datasets, including those related to urban heat island (UHI). Visit the [NCEI Climate Data Online (CDO)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/) portal to search for UHI datasets. You can explore various temperature measurements and urban-rural comparisons.

#### Global Surface Summary of the Day (GSOD): 
The GSOD dataset, available through the NCEI, contains daily weather observations from thousands of weather stations worldwide. You can utilize this dataset to analyze temperature differences between urban and nearby rural stations to study the UHI effect.

#### OpenStreetMap (OSM) data: 
OpenStreetMap provides crowd-sourced geospatial data, including information on land cover and urban infrastructure. You can extract OSM data using tools like [Overpass Turbo](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) and utilize it to analyze land cover characteristics and urbanization patterns for UHI studies.

#### Remote sensing datasets: 
Satellite-based remote sensing data can be valuable for studying UHI. Datasets such as Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel offer thermal infrared bands that can help quantify land surface temperature differences between urban and rural areas. Access these datasets through platforms like [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) or specific data providers' websites. 

Check - ***NASA ARSET Program*** where they have used **Landsat-8** data especially **Band-10** for the ![[Urban Heat Island#^UHICalculation]] using this equation.

Local government or research institution websites: Local governments and research institutions often conduct UHI studies and may make their datasets available on their websites. Check the websites of city planning departments, environmental agencies, or universities in your region of interest for UHI-related datasets.

Academic research repositories: Explore academic research repositories like [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [figshare](https://figshare.com/) for UHI-related datasets. Researchers often deposit their datasets as supplementary materials accompanying published articles or as standalone datasets for public access.

When using these datasets, ensure that you comply with any licensing requirements, attribute the data appropriately, and follow any usage restrictions specified by the data providers.

Please note that the availability and extent of UHI datasets can vary depending on the region, specific study parameters, and the time period covered.
